# bavaria_wheat_trials_2
My most recent (c. May/June 2021) iteration of the yield trial mapping project.

## This map
This map shows the locations of variety trial sites (places where they grow new crop varieties to assess their performance) for winter wheat in Bavaria, Germany. The number of varieties tested varies by site, and also by year. To deal with this, I incorporate a year slider so that the user can specify the year. The number of varieties at each site (in that year) is represented by the size of the circles representing each site. 

Suppose the user wishes to know how many varieties were tested in a location called Reith, in the year 2000. Not only would they see the number (17), but also the names of those 17 winter wheat varieties.

## The data depicted
1. the number and names of varieties at each site, each year (these are publicly available at https://www.lfl.bayern.de/ipz/getreide/019108/index.php, but my colleague put these all together into a usable file).
2. agro-ecological zones (this shapefile came from the German Statistics Office for Land and Agriculture).
3. current wheat-growing regions (this shapefile also came from the German Statistics Office for Land and Agriculture).
